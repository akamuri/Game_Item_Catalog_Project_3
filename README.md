SETUP NOTES
-----------
1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox if you have not done so already. Instructions on how to do so can be found on the websites as well as in the course materials..
2. Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository. There is a catalog folder provided for you, but no files have been included. If a catalog folder does not exist, simply create your own inside of the vagrant folder.
3. Launch the Vagrant VM (by typing vagrant up in the directory fullstack/vagrant from the terminal). You can find further instructions on how to do so here.
4. Write the Flask application locally in the /vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM). Name it application.py.
5. Run your application within the VM by typing python /vagrant/catalog/application.py into the Terminal. If you named the file from step 4 as something other than application.py, in the above command substitute in the file name on your computer.
6. Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally on your browser.
